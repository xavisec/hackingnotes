# 🛠️ Hacking Notes by Xavi

This is my personal knowledge base for offensive security, pentesting, OSINT, and red team tactics. These notes are built from real investigations, research, and technical exercises — used during CTFs, labs, and private assessments.

> 📌 I use this repo for quick recall during engagements, training, and tool development. It's a practical-first collection of syntax, techniques, and workflows I actually rely on.
